# Phase 1

Create geographical random graphs(GRGs) and compute their compatibility matrices (graphs).
Store the matrices into .txt files and pass them as input to the python code.

# Phase 2

Given the .txt files from Phase 1, locate the files into the same directory of the .py file.
Execute the python code to compute the MCLSs for each GRG.
The resulting sets of MCLSs are stored into .txt files.

# Phase 3

Given the .txt files of MCLSs for each graph, execute the matlab scripts to perform experiments.
In case of failure in either Phase 1 or 2, we provide some example files for reproducibility into the folder 'Example'
